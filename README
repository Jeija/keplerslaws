This program was originally made by Tobias Kramer in 1999 and
distributed under the GNU General Public License.
For some reason his program went oddly missing and I could only
recover this really awesome demonstration in the Internet Archive.
This version includes some fixes to make it work with today's libraries (2013)

Dependencies:
	Mesa + GLUT: libglut, libMesaGLU, libMesaGL
	X11: libXmu, libXi, libXext, libX11 (likely preinstalled on your linux)

How to compile:
	./configure
	make

Run:
	The binary is in ./kepler, so use ./kepler/kepler

You can also see this program in action in the "Kepler Museum" in Weil der Stadt, Germany
